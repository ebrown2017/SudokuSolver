# SudokuSolver

Take in a 9x9 Sudoku grid and return the correct solution if possible. This project uses a backtracking algorithm to recursively ensure that all conditions are met for a each tested value in the puzzle. 

To use:
Edit the inital 9x9 "board" at the top of the Solver.java file. Leave a number as 0 if you wish it to be considered an empty space.
